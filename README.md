# gpt4-generated-car-cadquery
A GPT4-generated python-script creating a simple car. I cannot agree that the model is "detailed", but I find it impressive that a language model like GPT4 can create a 3D model by just asking a question.


## Instructions for use by Chat GPT 4

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install CadQuery**: Open a terminal or command prompt and install the CadQuery library by running the following command:

```sh
pip install cadquery
```

3. **Save the car generator script**: Create a new Python file (e.g., `detailed_car_generator.py`) and paste the provided detailed car generator script code into the file. Save it in a convenient location on your system.

4. **Run the script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the `detailed_car_generator.py` file, and run the following command:

```sh
python detailed_car_generator.py
```

This command will execute the script and generate the car model as a STEP file named "detailed_car_model.step" in the same folder where the script is located.

5. **Import the model into your 3D printer slicing software**: Open your 3D printer slicing software and import the "detailed_car_model.step" file. Adjust the settings, scale, and orientation as necessary, then proceed to slice the model and print it.

Please note that the provided car generator script creates a detailed version of a car model. The model may not be perfect and might require further modifications, depending on your 3D printer settings and requirements.
